# ML Pipeline Template

This repository provides a Python script to set up a standard directory structure for machine learning projects. It helps you organize files and directories into a structured format that is ideal for developing, testing, and deploying ML models.

## Files

- `script.py`: A Python script to create a structured directory for an ML pipeline project.
- `Image.png`: An image showing the directory structure created by the script.

## Features

- **Automatic Directory Creation:** Creates essential directories for data, notebooks, source code, configuration, and more.
- **Placeholder Files:** Generates placeholder files with sample content to help you get started quickly.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhanl6/ML-Template.git
   cd ML-Template
   ```

2. **Edit the Script:**
   - Open script and modify the `main()` function to set your desired base directory and project name.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Make sure Python is installed. Run the script with:
